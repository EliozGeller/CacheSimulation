## TGDriverCode
### Packet trace generation
By editing ``GenerateTraces.py`` and using the class ``TGScenario`` a specific configuration can 
be defined and used to generate a trace.

### Analyzing the trace
The usage ``PlotTrace.py`` can be done in two parts, generate a `plot_trace.json` and use it
to create figures, used for fast plotting and avoiding the heavy work of traversing the entire trace.
